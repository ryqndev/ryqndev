# Who am I?

I am a developer specializing in front-end and UI/UX development. My passion lies in creating beautiful, functional, and intuitive user experiences using some of the latest web technologies while pushing the boundaries of the available tech. 


## Tech Stack

*My most comfortable web tech stack:*
[React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

*Although I have experience with:*
- HTML/CSS/JS
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

### Web libraries (non-inclusive)
*Some libraries I like working with*
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) / [r3f](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)
- [@airbnb/visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/)
- [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) / [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/)

### Styling
I prefer to custom style all my projects since I usually have custom designs in mind or am working with a designer. However, I find myself reusing certain components or styling architectural styles and to that end, I've been developing my own (i.e. extremely opinionated) open-source styling library.

### Backend
Unless there's a specific use case, I opt for client-side rendered ([Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) included) applications but I am comfortable with SSR with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) (or as an API layer).

### Some of my projects:
- [https://ryqn.dev](https://ryqn.dev) - my personal portfolio site and playground where I test out new technologies and experiment with new ideas
- [https://boba.watch](https://boba.watch) - my oldest, personal favorite project that tracks your boba spending and manages tons of user data while displaying it in interactive data visualization components in the browser
- [https://pickban.pro](https://pickban.pro) - a custom built web app to help LoL coaches/scrim managers practice or perform champ select and provides live analytics using historical tournament data (public release version not 100% up-to-date)
- **learn series** - series of tools and websites that are meant to teach coding. Not all tutorials are accessible from public (mostly links that I memorized that I hand out during mentoring at hackathons) so dm me if you want to see a tutorial. Some examples: [[articles and tutorials](https://learn.ryqn.dev), [R ggplot samples](https://data-vis.learn.ryqn.dev)]
## I've seen you at a hackathon

If you've been to a collegiate hackathon (US only), you probably have seen me so if that's you, feel free to dm me if you want to talk or have questions! I've been to about 50+ hackathons by now and if you're an organizer looking for a mentor or workshop lead, I would love to help out! (dm me for more info on what topics I can cover and sample workshop material I've done for prev. workshops)
